# @ember/test-helpers [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/emberjs/ember-test-helpers.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/emberjs/ember-test-helpers)

A test-framework-agnostic set of helpers for testing Ember.js applications.

## Usage

This library is best used by way of a test-framework-specific
wrapper, such as [ember-qunit](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-qunit) or
[ember-mocha](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-mocha).

## Test Helpers

The exports of this library are intended to be utility functions that can be used to bring the
standard Ember testing experience to any testing framework.

A quick summary of the exports from the `ember-test-helpers` module:

* `setApplication` - This function is used to allow the rest of the setup
  functions to build a valid container/registry which can be used to lookup
  instances and factories from your application.
* `setResolver` - When `setApplication` has not been ran, this function is used to allow the other
  functions build a valid container/registry that is able to look objects up
  from your application (just as a running Ember application would).
* `setContext` - Invoked by the host testing framework to set the current testing context (generally
  the `this` within a running test).
* `getContext` - Used to retrieve the current testing context.
* `unsetContext` - Used to ensure that all handles on the testing context are released (allowing GC).
* `setupContext` - Sets up a given testing context with `owner`, `get`, `set`, etc properties.
* `teardownContext` - Cleans up any objects created as part of the owner created in `setupContext`.
* `setupRenderingContext` - Sets up the provided context with the ability to render template
  snippets by adding `render`, `clearRender`, etc.
* `teardownRenderingContext` - Cleans up any work done in a rendering test.
* `settled` - Returns a promise which will resolve when all async from AJAX, test waiters, and
  scheduled timers have completed.
* `validateErrorHandler` - Used to ensure that the `Ember.onerror` error handler properly re-throws any errors during testing.
